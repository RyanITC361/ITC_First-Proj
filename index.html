        <h2> Education</h2>
      I am a computer science major right now at Brigham Young University. I am a sophomore and I am currently 
      interested in cybersecurity as I think it is a rather awesome profession. I currently have some coding experience and 
      not a whole lot of cybersecurity experience although I am gradually gaining more and more experience.

        <h2> Hobbies</h2>
      I have recently taken up an interest in crocheting although I've lacked the time to pursue it a lot. I also like to 
      play with my dog and to read books. I also enjoy playing video games and playing games with my family. Sometimes I enjoy going out and doing things outdoors 
      as well.

        <h2> Achievements </h2>
      I have had a number of achievements throughout my life, they range from getting the Eagle Scout, graduating high school
      getting a job (was way harder than I expected), some coding projects like building my own website with a frontend, backend and database. 
      There are several more achievements as well that I've gotten but they're more minor achievements that a lot of people around me have gotten 
      like being able to live on my own (also harder than I thought) and getting into BYU.
